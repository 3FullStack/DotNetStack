# DotNetStack
.NET technology stack, including frameworks, SDKs, tools etc

![Image of The Dot NET Stack](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/unruledboy/DotNetStack/master/1.2/Dot Net Stack.png)

# What and why?
Have you ever wondered:
* what technologies .NET really includes? 
* how many do I possess?


I could not find a really comprehensive diagram that shows the .NET technology stack, so I come up with my own version.

There might be issues here and there, like the category, the individual ones, but the beautity is you can modify it as you want.
